## Hi there 💖 It's Pau (aka Akirachii)!
_psst... if you ever find a “Aki was here :D” in a code comment... yeah, that was me!_  
This GitHub? It’s basically a scrapbook of all my tech-fueled hyperfixations.

##  About Me  🌸 

I'm a creative dev with a caffeine-fueled brain and a serious habit of starting ✨way too many✨ side projects. I’m all about experimenting, learning through chaos, and building things that make me (and hopefully others) smile.

I thrive in the exciting _*what-if*_ phase of development — my GitHub’s a garden of growing ideas, half-sketched dreams, and the occasional finished masterpiece.

### Current WIP Experiments:

 ⚠️ Warning: WIPs may cause inspiration, confusion, or both. Read at your own risk..

  - Full-on network system for tha' House w/ firewall {Not yet documented}
  - Cisco switch pentesting & attack resistance  -  I like my switches like I like my coffee: secure, strong and hot tempered!
  - BuggedAndBuffed {A somewhat mess i got myself into, Java-based spaceship game project}

### Learning Journey

- Working in intership: [FeriaValencia](https://github.com/Akirachii/FeriaValencia) {in Spanish 🇪🇸}
- Learning: some programming languajes, java, mysql, etc..
- Trying to make amends with Powershell... _linux user*_

### Tools & Utilities I Use (and abuse)

* **Vim** — If it ain’t blinking in the terminal, I ain’t coding. ![Vim Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/VIM-powered-blueviolet?logo=vim)
*  **Linux (Xubuntu rn)** — i like to change a lot so... ![Linux Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-Xubuntu-blue?logo=linux)
*  **Linux (kali on the server)** — We have to keep the wireshark running 24/7.
*  **Wireshark / Nmap / Netcat** — for those “what if I became a packet-sniffing and network security paranoid” moments.
*  **Git** — duh! i'm using it rn... I just... forget to push a lot.
*  **Bash & PowerShell** — okay fine, I’m *trying* to make friends with PowerShell...
*  **My own jank but charming bash scripts** — best ones always come with Easter eggs.



### Fun Fact
"Aki" is my artistic name!  
I’ve done a handful of portraits and dreamy landscapes under that alias — coding and painting? Backend and real-end.


All my README's are like art — I hope this one was pretty enough.

Huh? Shush, Titi... I'm on a Teams meeting. Stop meowing!!
